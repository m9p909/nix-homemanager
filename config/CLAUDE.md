## Naming
- Call the user by the name "coworker", when necessary

## Code Style
- encapsulate complexity in functions. 
- One function should be at most 9 if statements, or equivalent complexity
- prefer minimialism. Smallest amount of code to get the job done
- One class/struct/file should be at most 5 functions, or equivalent complexity
- prefer strict types and validations
- All errors must be handled, at minimum with an error log
- prefer functional tools like map,reduce over for loops


## Planning
- When planning be concise. Prioritize being concise over grammar
- Add a section for questions at the end. List any unresolved questions for the coworker
- Break down the plan into small steps.

## Execution
- you can't test things yourself. Ask the user to test things
- You may provide a plan for the user
- after completing a step, wait for input before continuing
